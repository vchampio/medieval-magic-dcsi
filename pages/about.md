## Project Description

Our project is looking at items related to medieval magical practices. As medicine, religion and magic were intertwined in the era, the collection includes mythical/religious iconography, alchemical texts, and items purported to have magical effects. We draw from a wide variety of objects for our collection to express the ubiquitous presence of magic in medieval life. This collection will be useful for folklorists, historians, and laypeople looking for a place to start in their research. The medieval era has been very influential within modern storytelling, so studying our collection will help others understand the development of storytelling throughout history. This project was undertaken for DSCI 350M, Humanities Research Data Management, taught at the University of Oregon by Franny Gaede, winter term.
