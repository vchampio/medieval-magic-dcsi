## Data Management Plan

# Project Description

Our project is looking at items related to medieval magical practices. As medicine, religion and magic were intertwined in the era, the collection includes mythical/religious iconography, alchemical texts, and items purported to have magical effects. We draw from a wide variety of objects for our collection to express the ubiquitous presence of magic in medieval life. This collection will be useful for folklorists, historians, and laypeople looking for a place to start in their research. The medieval era has been very influential within modern storytelling, so studying our collection will help others understand the development of storytelling throughout history. 

# Personnel, Roles & Responsibilities

Claire O’Connor is a third-year undergrad student at the University of Oregon studying English, digital humanities and business administration. As project manager and co-collection manager, she works to plan, manage, and organize the research project and data collected within the group. She facilitates communication and coordination between team members.

Vanessa Champion is a third year undergrad student at the University of Oregon, studying history, folklore and digital humanities. As repository and co-collection manager, she curates the data collection in order to make a cohesive topic, and makes sure that it’s neatly entered in the repository. 
If a team member leaves the project, their responsibilities will be redistributed among the remaining members based on expertise and workload capacity. Additionally, we will document processes and maintain clear records to facilitate a smooth transition.

# Expected Data

We are expecting to collect a wide variety of data about medieval medicine and alchemy practices within a shared Google Drive folder, which will be shared in our GitHub repository. Within the drive folder, we will have a folder for images of the data collected, collaborative working documents and notes, and a Google Sheets file that will store our meta data. Our meta data sheet will collect and store data about the origin of the pieces, focusing on the century and country of origin. 

# Period of Data Retention

The period of data retention will be until 2026, when the personnel graduate and leave the University of Oregon. 

# Data Formats and Dissemination

Our data will be shared via CollectionBuilder, and will be viewable as a website. Our audience will also be able to export the data from CollectionBuilder themselves. The website will publish images in the format of PNGs, and include further information about the pieces being published, highlighting their origins of creation.

# Data Storage and Preservation of Access

Our data on CollectionBuilder is being stored within our Google Drive folder as well as on our personal computers as backup. Our repository manager will burn the metadata and image files onto a cd for long term storage. Access will be preserved by sharing with the readers where the artifacts can be acquired through other sources, including the museums they are accessed through.
