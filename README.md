## Collection Information

Our collection, Medieval Magic, is looking at items related to medieval magical practices. As medicine, religion and magic were intertwined in the era, the collection includes mythical/religious iconography, alchemical texts, and items purported to have magical effects. We draw from a wide variety of objects for our collection to express the ubiquitous presence of magic in medieval life. This collection will be useful for folklorists, historians, and laypeople looking for a place to start in their research. The medieval era has been very influential within modern storytelling, so studying our collection will help others understand the development of storytelling throughout history.
